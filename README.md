This Java program represents a simple library system, featuring classes for Book and User implemented as a record. The system allows users to interact with a console-based interface, enabling operations such as adding books, displaying available books, issuing books to users, and returning books. The code showcases fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, encapsulation, and user interaction in Java. I've incorporated a straightforward structure, employing lists to manage the library's state. It serves as a practical example for those looking to understand the basics of class design, immutability using records, and building a console-based application. Feel free to explore and modify it based on your learning needs or expand its features for a more comprehensive library management system.
